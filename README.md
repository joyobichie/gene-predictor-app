## ‚ú® Features

*   **Interactive Trait Selection:** Select phenotypes for 20 different genetic traits for both parents.
*   **Simple, Intuitive UI:** A clean and modern user interface built with React.
*   **Progress Tracking:** A visual progress bar shows how many traits you have completed.
*   **Instant Predictions:** (Describe what happens at the end - e.g., "View a summary of potential offspring phenotypes.")

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, container-based architecture.

*   **Frontend:**
    *   [React](https://reactjs.org/) (with Vite) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Backend:**
    *   [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - A high-level Python web framework.
*   **Infrastructure & DevOps:**
    *   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - For containerizing the frontend and backend services.
    *   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) - For easy local development orchestration.
    *   [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) - For container orchestration in a cluster environment.
    *   [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) - The CI/CD pipeline is defined in the `Jenkinsfile` for automated builds and deployments.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (Included with Docker Desktop)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd gene-predictor-app
    ```

2.  **Create environment files:**
    You need to create `.env` files for both the frontend and backend services. Example files are provided.

    *   **For the backend:**
        ```bash
        cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
        ```
        *(Note: You may need to create the `.env.example` file first with `SECRET_KEY=...` and `DEBUG=...`)*

    *   **For the frontend:**
        ```bash
        cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
        ```
        *(Note: You may need to create the `.env.example` file first with `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`)*

3.  **Build and run the containers using Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

4.  **Access the application:**
    *   Frontend UI: [**http://localhost:5173**](http://localhost:5173)
    *   Backend API: [**http://localhost:8000**](http://localhost:8000)

## ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes Deployment

These instructions explain how to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster.

### Prerequisites

*   A running Kubernetes cluster (e.g., the one enabled in Docker Desktop).
*   `kubectl` command-line tool configured to talk to your cluster.
*   A Docker Hub account and the Docker CLI.

### Deployment Steps

1.  **Log in to Docker Hub:**
    ```bash
    docker login
    ```

2.  **Build and push the Docker images:**
    Replace `joyobichie` with your Docker Hub username.
    ```bash
    # Build and push the backend image
    docker build -t joyobichie/gene-predictor-app-backend:latest ./backend
    docker push joyobichie/gene-predictor-app-backend:latest

    # Build and push the frontend image
    docker build -t joyobichie/gene-predictor-app-frontend:latest ./frontend
    docker push joyobichie/gene-predictor-app-frontend:latest
    ```

3.  **Apply the Kubernetes manifests:**
    The manifest files in the `deployment/` directory define all the necessary Kubernetes resources.
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f deployment/
    ```

4.  **Check the status and access the application:**
    *   Wait for the pods to be in the `Running` state:
        ```bash
        kubectl get pods -w
        ```
    *   Get the service URL:
        ```bash
        kubectl get service frontend-service
        ```
    *   Access the app in your browser at the `EXTERNAL-IP` and `PORT` listed (e.g., [**http://localhost:5173**](http://localhost:5173)).
